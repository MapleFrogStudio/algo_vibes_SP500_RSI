CALCULATIONG RSI
Step 1: Calculate Up & Down Moves
UpMoves : 
- Take the daily return if return is positive
- Take 0 if daily return is negative or zero
DownMoves:
- Absolute value of daily return if return is negative
- Zero if return is positive or zero

Step 2: Averaging Up & Down Moves
1. Pick an average method : Simple moving average (SMA), exponetial moving average (EMA)
2. We will take the Wilder's smooting Method (WSM) which is the same as an exponetial moving average but with different smoothing factor
- Smooting factor in exponential moving average: alpha = 2 / (N + 1)  where N is RSI Period (10 for us)
- Smooting factor in WSM: alpha = 1/N where N is 19 

Step 3: RS and RSI calculation
- RS = Average Up move / Average Down move
- RSI = 100 - 100 / (1 + RS)
