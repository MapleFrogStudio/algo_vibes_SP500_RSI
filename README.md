#### ref: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXCSPC3Kw18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXCSPC3Kw18)  
  
Used this RSI strategy to generate nuy & sell signals  
Followed by a loggin of trades (tried to remove trades that were generate when already in position)  
Analysis is done on the trades log  
  
RESULTS:  
Awful, I loss of -6000$, so needs to be tweeked.  
Hope it's not a logic error in my code :)
